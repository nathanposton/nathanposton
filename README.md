Hi, Iâ€™m Nathan Poston

Me:
- Arizona native

Currently employed as a Full-Stack Web Developer at RTA: The Fleet Success Company

About Me:

I just love to build. That's what brought me here and that's what drives me forward.
If you gave me a fortune and told me to live the good life, you'd still find me right here.
