About Me:
I found my way to computer science through medical research, initially as a prospective medical professional. I loved holding scalpels for experimental spinal surgeries, executing behavior therapies for autism research, and digging into medical publications. When a physician asked me to assist him in developing a small program to keep him informed on patient status, I discovered a love and aptitude for coding. After jumping into a research assistant role in BYU’s Advanced Information Retrieval Applications Laboratory, I decided once and for all that my fingers crave the keyboard more than the calipers.

Through school, research, and entry-level employment, I have pursued technical skills and experience to be an asset on any development team. I have built and maintained current websites, published an android app, trained machine learning classifiers, published information retrieval research, and have written a complete functional shell. Challenging tasks drive my best work; I am always ready for more.
